Keycloak authenticator that delivers One-Time Passwords (OTP) via Telegram when users attempt to log in.

## Features
- Sends OTP codes to users via Telegram during authentication.
- Integrates seamlessly with Keycloak's authentication flow.
- Configurable Telegram bot settings.
- Works with Keycloak 23.0.7.

## Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- Keycloak 23.0.7
- Telegram bot token (get it from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)).

## Installation
1. Build the plugin:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```
2. Copy the generated JAR file from `target/keycloak-telegram-auth-1.0.0.jar` to your Keycloak's `providers` directory:
   ```bash
   cp target/keycloak-telegram-auth-1.0.0.jar $KEYCLOAK_HOME/providers/
   ```
3. Restart Keycloak.

## Environment Variables

The plugin requires the following environment variables to be set:

### Required
- `TELEGRAM_PROXY_URL` - URL of your proxy server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/webhook`)

### Docker/Docker Compose Example
```yaml
services:
  keycloak:
    environment:
      - TELEGRAM_PROXY_URL=http://telegram-proxy:8000/webhook
```

### System Environment
```bash
export TELEGRAM_PROXY_URL="http://localhost:8000/webhook"
```

## Proxy Server Setup

This plugin uses a custom proxy server to send Telegram messages. The proxy server should:

1. **Accept GET requests** with the following parameters:
   - `phone` - Telegram chat ID of the user
   - `code` - The complete message including client ID and OTP code

2. **Example Flask proxy server**:
```python
import telebot
from flask import Flask, request
from creds import telegrambotapi

bot = telebot.TeleBot(telegrambotapi)
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['GET','POST'])
def webhook():
    try:
        args_dict = request.args
        chat_id = args_dict.get('phone')
        code = args_dict.get('code')
        
        bot.send_message(chat_id, text=code)
        return f'done, code was sent to: {chat_id}\nCode: {code}'
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e) + ' user might not be found'

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
```

3. **Example request to proxy**:
```
GET http://localhost:8000/webhook?phone=123456789&code=Your%20OTP%20code%20for%20grafana%20is%3A%20123456
```

## Keycloak Configuration
1. In Keycloak Admin Console:
   - Navigate to Authentication â†’ Flows.
   - Create a new flow or copy an existing one.
   - Add "Telegram OTP Authenticator" execution.

2. **User Setup**:
   - Users must have `telegram_chat_id` attribute set in their profile
   - This attribute should contain their Telegram chat ID
   - Can be configured via LDAP or directly in Keycloak user attributes

## Usage

### User Setup
1. Users must have their Telegram chat ID configured in the `telegram_chat_id` attribute.
2. To get Telegram chat ID, users can:
   - Send a message to your bot
   - Use [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to get their chat ID

### Authentication Flow
1. User attempts to log in to a Keycloak-protected application.
2. After primary authentication, they receive an OTP via Telegram.
3. The message format: "Your OTP code for {client_id} is: {6-digit-code}"
4. User enters the 6-digit OTP code to complete authentication.
5. OTP codes expire after 2 minutes.
6. Users can request a new code using the "Resend Code" button.

### Message Format
The OTP message includes the client application name:
- For Grafana: "Your OTP code for grafana is: 123456"
- For Portainer: "Your OTP code for portainer is: 123456"
- Default: "Your OTP code for Keycloak is: 123456"
